The package creates an on disk sqlite database to hold data of an organism 
combined from an 'org' package (e.g., org.Hs.eg.db) and agenome coordinate 
functionality of the 'TxDb' package (e.g., TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene). 
It aims to provide an integrated presentation of identifiers and genomic 
coordinates.
